### Takeaways

Hold out some of your sample into a validation set. Train on the remaining data (training set) and evaluate your error or risk on this validation set. The hypothesis space corresponding to the lowest validation error is the right complexity..it is not too simple to have large bias, nor too complex that its predictions are overfit and thus not robust.
